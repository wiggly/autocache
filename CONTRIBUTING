Source code repo can be found on github at the URL below, patches welcome.

Additionally feel free to begin adding extra strategies/stores in seperate
distributions under the Autocache namespace.

The internal API, especially around configuration is very, very, very fluid
right now, you should expect things to change rapidly until we reach a v1
release.
