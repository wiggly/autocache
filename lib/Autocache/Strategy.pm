=head1 NAME

Autocache::Store - Cached data storage base class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class for objects that provide storage for Autocache record
objects.

All the methods defined in this class are no-ops that conform to the below
documentation.

See also L<Autocache::Record>.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods should be overridden by concrete implementations.

Most sub-classes will over-ride all of them.

If a sub-class does over-ride a particular method it must adhere to the
behaviour described below.

In all cases C<$key> is a string that uniquely identifies the cache record
and C<$record> is an instance of L<Autocache::Record>.

=head2 C<get>

    $record = $store->get( $key );

Find a record identifed by the supplied key and return it, or undef if the
store does not contain a record related to the supplied key.

=head2 C<set>

    $record = $store->set( $key, $record );

Store the record under the supplied key and return the record.

=head2 C<delete>

    $record = $store->delete( $key );

Find a record identifed by the supplied key, delete it from the store and
return it, or undef.

=head2 C<clear>

    $store->clear();

Clear all records from this store.
