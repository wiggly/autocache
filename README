Autocache - An automatic caching framework for Perl.

This code came about as the result of attempting to refactor, simplify and
extend the caching used on a rather large website.

It provides a framework for configuring multiple caches at different levels,
process, server, networked and declaratively configuring which functions
have their results cached, and how.

Please see the INSTALLATION and LICENCE files in this directory for more
information.
